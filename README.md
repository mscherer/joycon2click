A quick rust software to convert button push on a Joycon (Nintendo Switch 
controller) to a key, in order to pass on the next slide on Libreoffice.

# Usage

Build with `cargo build -r`, run `target/release/joycon2click`.

Once the joycon is connected, any button will be converted to a keyboard
keypress on Right key.
